# LetUsPython

This repository contains all the solutions to the book  

**##"Let us Python by Yashwant Kanitkar" . **



The repo only contains solution for coding problems and not the theory questions. 


Theory questions are answered seperately in my personal notebook. 


The coding concepts explained in the chapter and its exercise both are solved in this repository.
